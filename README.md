## Organizing the material by class
The courses are held every week, with one class on Wednesdays from 8:15 am to 13:30 am. The materials are divided into weeks, each of the weeks beginning with an identifier **@week** - {**week-number**} where :
- {**week-number**} is the week numbers described in the syllabus

**Disclaimer**

## Organizing Material by Activity
In each of the folders, you can find materials that will be easily divided into two categories.
* Exercises in class. During the active exercises, a topic will be discussed and many examples and tasks will be solved. You will find the practical solutions in the **$course-work** folder
* Self-study exercises. After the end of most of the exercises, self-study tasks will be given to improve your understanding of the concepts we have examined. You can find the homework assignments in the **$home-work** folder
* Extra materials used during the course activities. You can find them in the **$extra-work** folder
